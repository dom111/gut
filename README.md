# gut
For when you mistype `git`.

## What?

I was trying to get something committed quickly earlier and ended up typing `gut add filename` and continuing on to `git commit --amend --no-edit`, `git push -f`, `git tag 1.2.3 -m v1.2.3`, `git push --tags`, even going so far as to ask my colleague to try again before reaslising my mistake.

Never again.
